# AP Style LaTeX Template

This is a LaTeX template that aims to superficially emulate the layout of an AP-exam style test - both the Free
Response, and Multiple Choice portions. It is designed to compile with TeXLive 2023, but should also compile
on tectonic and other similar distributions. As it is based on TeXLive, it will, of course, work on Overleaf.

## How to compile locally

This will repository is configured to automatically compile and release a PDF to its releases page on any push to the main branch. However, if you
want to compile and edit it locally (eg. to test out LaTeX formatting), you should compile it using `latexmk`, by entering the project's root directory
and running `latexmk`. We recommend you install the TeXLive LaTeX distribution, to ensure you have all the necessary packages and CLI tools to build the
document properly.
